Java Algorithms
===============

Just using this repository to keep track of my exercises in Algorithms.


Data Structures
---------------

| Data Structure | Description                            | Usage                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Array          | Most common data structure used, ever. | Everywhere, behind the scenes!     |
| Stack          | Consider it as a conceptual aid.       | Word reversing, bracket delimiters |
| Queue          |                                        |                                    |
| Circular Queue | Or also named *ring buffer*           |                                    |


Sorting
-------

| Algorithm      | Running Time in Big O Notation | Better than                           |
|----------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort    | O(N^2)                         | N/A                                   |
| Selection Sort | O(N^2)                         | Bubble Sort                           |
| Insertion Sort | O(N^2)                         | Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort (usually) |
